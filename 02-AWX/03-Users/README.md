Creating a New Organization

1. Login -> Left Menu -> Select Access 
2. You can create a user by selecting the button user.



## An organization has several attributes that may be configured:

1. Enter the appropriate details into the following required fields:
```
• First Name
• Last Name
• Organization (Choose from an existing organization–this is the default organization if you are using a Self-
Supported level license.)
• Email
• Username
• Password
• Confirmation Password
• User Type
```

2. Three types of Tower Users can be assigned:
```
• Normal User: Normal Users have read and write access limited to the resources (such as inventory, projects,and job templates) for which that user has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.
• System Auditor: Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects within the Tower environment.
• System Administrator: A Tower System Administrator (also known as Superuser) has full system administration privileges for Tower – with full read and write privileges over the entire Tower installation. A System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of Tower and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various Users. Assign with caution!
```
